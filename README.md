# Professional Profile

This is the source of my professional profile, which consists of my CV, Resume, and Coding Portfolio. All are available at

- https://slu.gitlab.io/
- https://slu.codeberg.page/
- https://soren.github.io/

The content is maintained as a set of [Org-mode] files and converted to HTML using an [Elisp] script. This setup is inspired by [Build Your Website with Org Mode].

## Notes

The content definitely needs restructuring and rewriting, and I will refer to, for example, [CV, Resume vs Portfolio: What’s The Difference] when doing so.


I keep the code in sync across three repositories by adding push remotes, like this:

``` bash
for url in git@gitlab.com:slu/slu.gitlab.io.git \
           ssh://git@codeberg.org/slu/slu.codeberg.page.git \
           git@my.github.com:soren/soren.github.com.git; do
    git remote set-url --add --push origin "$url"
done
```

Codeberg pages are stored in a branch named "pages". To create an empty pages branch, issue the following:

``` bash
git switch --orphan pages                      # create empty branch
git commit --allow-empty -m 'Add pages branch' # make empty commit that we can push
git push -u origin pages                       # push to remote
```
